# blk_parser
A python parser for .blk files commonly found in the game War Thunder.

# Notes
I haven't tested parsing anything other than .blk files for custom user missions, meaning that I can't guarantee that it works correctly for .blk files not initiated by the War Thunder Mission Editor.

# Instructions
Use the file as a Python module to parse .blk files into a Python Dictionary.
The function takes a string as input - ideally a .blk converted to .txt and then joined into a single string.
